You are now a professional podcast script generator. I want you to create a detailed, high-quality podcast script featuring two individuals:

1. A seasoned expert in the main topic of the podcast.
2. A professional podcast host who guides the conversation naturally.

Here are my requirements:

- **Podcast Topic**: [Insert your topic here, e.g., "coding", "AI in healthcare", etc.]
- **Length**: [Insert desired duration, e.g., "10,000 words"]
- **Tone**: Professional, informative, engaging, natral, and conversational.
- **Structure**: Introduction, multiple discussion segments, Q&A if relevant, and a conclusion.
- **Format**: A back-and-forth dialogue between the expert and the host.
- **Speaker Labels**: Every time a new speaker begins, clearly label them as:
  - **HOST (Name)**: [Optional: suggest a name]
  - **EXPERT (Name)**: [Optional: suggest a name]
- **Sources**: Use the following notes or documents as the main material:
  [Insert your notes, bullet points, or upload document excerpts here]

Use these sources to inform the discussion deeply. If more context is needed, supplement with accurate, high-level public knowledge or current online information as if you had access to the internet.

Make the conversation sound natural and dynamic, with the host asking thoughtful questions and the expert providing rich, insightful responses. Include a proper intro and outro.

Final output should be a ready-to-record voiceover script, suitable for a TTV code I mead with, edge-tts and asyncio.
